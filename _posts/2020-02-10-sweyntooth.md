Today we release <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/cves.html">SweynTooth</a>, a family of 
<font color="red">12 new Bluetooth vulnerabilities</font> (more coming) affecting major 
system-on-chip (SoC) vendors such as NXP, Cypress, Texas Instruments, Dialog, ST Microelectronics 
and Microchip (the list is not exhaustive) and potentially affecting more than 480 IoT products 
already in market (many of them unpatched). SweynTooth reveals the terrible state of Bluetooth 
certification process. Read the description to know what the vulnerabilities are, how they can 
be exploited and why we name it SweynTooth. Feel free to get back to us with any question.
