Today we release <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/cves.html">SweynTooth</a>, a family of 
<font color="red">12 new Bluetooth vulnerabilities</font> (more coming) affecting major 
system-on-chip (SoC) vendors such as <i>NXP, Cypress, Texas Instruments, Dialog, ST Microelectronics 
and Microchip</i> (the list is not exhaustive) and potentially affecting more than <i>480 IoT products</i>
already in market (most of them unpatched). SweynTooth reveals the terrible state of Bluetooth 
certification process. Read the <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/cves.html">description</a> 
to know what the vulnerabilities are, how they can be exploited and why we name it SweynTooth.
