#### Aequitas 
[Aequitas](https://github.com/sakshiudeshi/Aequitas) is a directed fairness testing framework machine learning models. See the paper [Automated Directed Fairness Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00468) for more details.

#### Ogma
[Ogma](https://github.com/sakshiudeshi/Ogma) provides a systematic test framework for machine-learning systems that accept grammar-based inputs. See the paper [Grammar Based Directed Testing of Machine Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10027) for more details.

#### AGRID
[AGRID](https://gitlab.com/asset-sutd/public/agrid) aims at encoding discrete models of robotic systems to support 
verification of robotic software. It is able to encode models as either Satisfiability Modulo Theory or Bounded Model 
Checking problems.
