In this project, we investigate the security and safety of robotics 
systems. The objective is to obtain safety and security by design. 
To this end, we are designing effective and efficient fuzzing techniques 
to discover security flaws in robots, using light-weight solutions 
to meet both the security and performance goals, designing efficient 
verification algorithms to check various robotics-related safety 
properties and using domain-specific languages to synthesize 
robot controller code that satisfies correctness by construction.
