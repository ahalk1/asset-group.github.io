In this project, we investigate detection and mitigation of 
memory-safety attacks (e.g. buffer overflow) for cyber-physical 
systems. Current security solutions for memory-safety attacks 
are not directly applicable for cyber-physical systems (CPS) for 
several reasons. Firstly, most CPS enforce real-time constraints 
and it needs to be investigated whether security solutions 
for memory-safety attacks can meet the real-time constraints 
enforced by typical CPS. Secondly, the state-of-the-art 
memory-safety attack mitigation is to abort the system when 
a memory-safety attack is identified. Such a solution is also 
not applicable for CPS, as the availability of a CPS is 
equally important as security. To know more about our work
