In this project, we investigate systematic and automated testing 
of (IIoT) Wireless Protocols. Our initial work on over-the-air 
fuzzing has uncovered critical security vulnerabilities in popular 
wireless devices (currently undisclosed for confidentiality). Three 
CVEs has been assigned so far for the discovered vulnerabilities: 
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12586" target="_blank">CVE-2019-12586</a>, 
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12587" target="_blank">CVE-2019-12587</a> and 
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12588" target="_blank">CVE-2019-12588 </a>. 
We have also been assigned a bug bounty of 2.2K USD for finding 
a vulnerability that allow hijacking IoT devices to connect to 
enterprise network. Finally, our work has been succesfully deployed 
and tested on a real car (Toyota Altis 2016 version) to discover 
security vulnerabilities. We are massively expanding our work to 
provide a holistic and systematic framework for arbitrary wireless 
IoT device validation and testing. Our current work will soon be 
available in public as a technical report and tool. This work is 
also related to cyber-physical systems that support wireless access. 

Previously, we worked on memory-safety for cyber-physical systems 
that can be found in the following publications: 

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94496-8_2">ESSoS2018</a>,
