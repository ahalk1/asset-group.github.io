In this project, we investigate detection and mitigation of 
memory-safety attacks (e.g. buffer overflow) for cyber-physical 
systems. Current security solutions for memory-safety attacks 
are not directly applicable for cyber-physical systems (CPS) for 
several reasons. Firstly, most CPS enforce real-time constraints 
and it needs to be investigated whether security solutions 
for memory-safety attacks can meet the real-time constraints 
enforced by typical CPS. Secondly, the state-of-the-art 
memory-safety attack mitigation is to abort the system when 
a memory-safety attack is identified. Such a solution is also 
not applicable for CPS, as the availability of a CPS is 
equally important as security. To know more about our work 
here check the following publication:

For IIoT, we aim to answer the following research 
questions: 1) What are the different attack vectors to 
compromise the security of a given Industrial IoT (IIoT) 
device? 
2) Given a set of attacker models, how to automatically 
discover possible security breaches in IIoT devices? 
3) How do we design IIoT devices robust in terms of 
security (specifically, for DoS attacks and malware)?
