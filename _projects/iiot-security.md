In this project, we aim to answer the following research 
questions: 1) What are the different attack vectors to 
compromise the security of a given Industrial IoT (IIoT) 
device? 
2) Given a set of attacker models, how to automatically 
discover possible security breaches in IIoT devices? 
3) How do we design IIoT devices robust in terms of 
security (specifically, for DoS attacks and malware)?
